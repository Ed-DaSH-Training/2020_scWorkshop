# Understanding Sequencing Raw Data

## Class Environment

### Getting into AWS Instance

There is a nice breakdown from another Physalia course on instructions for different operating systems and accessing AWS.  It is called [Connection to the Amazon EC2 service](https://gitlab.com/bfosso/metabarcoding_physalia/-/blob/master/unix_short_tutorial/how_to_connect.md).  This will help with connecting to the AWS instance to run docker.  

```{bash ssh_aws, eval = FALSE}
## Example
ssh -i berlin.pem ubuntu@<PUBLIC IP ADDRESS> (e.g.34.219.254.245)

## Actual Command Example
ssh -i berlin.pem ubuntu@34.213.180.241
```

### Common Linux Commands

#### Lab 1a

  - check the your present directory
```{bash lab1a_pwd, eval = FALSE}
pwd
```

  - check history
```{bash lab1a_hist, eval = FALSE}
history
```

  - pipe history to grep to search for the cd command
```{bash, eval = FALSE}
history | grep cd
```

  - put history into a history.txt file
```{bash lab1a_hist_txt, eval = FALSE}
history > history.txt
```

  - make a directory called data
```{bash lab1a_mkdir, eval = FALSE}
mkdir data
```

  - change into data directory
```{bash lab1a_cd, eval = FALSE}
cd data
```

  - move history.txt file into data directory
```{bash lab1a_mv, eval = FALSE}
mv ../history.txt ./
```

  - check manual page of wget command
```{bash lab1a_man, eval = FALSE}
man wget
```

  - redirect wget maunual page output into a file called wget.txt
```{bash lab1a_man_wget, eval = FALSE}
man wget > wget.txt
```

  - return the lines that contain output in the wget.txt file
```{bash lab1a_cat, eval = FALSE}
cat wget.txt | grep output
```

```{bash lab1a_grep, eval = FALSE}
grep -i output wget.txt
```

  - Compress wget.txt file
```{bash lab1a_gzip, eval = FALSE}
gzip wget.txt
```

  - View Compressed file
```{bash lab1a_catgz, eval = FALSE}
cat wget.txt.qz
```
  

```{bash lab1a_zcat, eval = FALSE}
zcat wget.txt.qz
```


```{bash lab1a_less, eval = FALSE}
zcat wget.txt.qz | less
```


#### Git Commands 

Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

Go to your user directory and run the following command from git.  This will create a directory of all the course material inside your user directory.  After it is done cloning change directory into the 2020_scWorkshop directory where the course material is.  The commands are below.  

```{bash clone_repo, eval = FALSE}
## clone repository
git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/2020_scWorkshop.git
cd 2020_scWorkshop
```


## File formats

  - bcl
  - fastq
  - bam
  - mtx, tsv
  - hdf5 (.h5, .h5ad)
  
### View FASTQ Files

#### Viewing entire file
```{bash cat_fastq, eval = FALSE}
cat data/example_fastq.fastq
```

#### Viewing first 10 lines

```{bash head_fastq, eval = FALSE}
head data/example_fastq.fastq
```

#### Stream Viewing with less command

```{bash less_fastq, eval = FALSE}
less data/example_fastq.fastq
```


### View BAM Files

#### Viewing first 10 lines

```{bash sam_view_less, eval = FALSE}
samtools view data/ex1.bam | head
```

#### Stream Viewing with less command

```{bash sam_view_head, eval = FALSE}
samtools view data/ex1.bam | less
```


## Public data repositories

### Cellranger/10x

#### Lab 1b

10x PBMC data are hosted in https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/10x.files/samples/cell/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz

  - get 10x PBMC data
  - unzip data
  - explore directory
  - explore files


```{bash wget_pbmc, eval = FALSE}

wget https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/10x.files/samples/cell/pbmc3k/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz -O data/pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz
cd data; tar -xzf pbmc3k_filtered_gene_bc_matrices.tar.gz
cd ..
```


### GEO

 - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE81905


#### Lab 1c

  - ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE81nnn/GSE81905/matrix/GSE81905-GPL17021_series_matrix.txt.gz

 - go into that directory
 - get files and place them in the directory
 - View files (try keeping in compressed format and view that way)
 
```{bash wget_geo, eval = FALSE}

cd data; tar -xzf GSE81905-GPL19057_series_matrix.txt.gz
cd ..
```

### Single Cell Portal

  - Get R2 fastq file from the Salk Institute study 
  - Look at files
  
  
#### Lab 1e

  - Get Docker on your local computer for you to have 
  - Explore Single Cell Portal
  - Explore GEO
  
  
  
## Docker Commands

Docker provides a consistent compute enviornment to ensure all software that you need is on the machine and able to be used. It will give you the version you need and help reduce software conflicts that may arise.

  - make sure you are in the directory from the cloned repository directory
  - run following command to start docker script
  
```{bash run_script_bash, eval = FALSE}
# chmod 600 ./docker/run_docker_bash.sh
./docker/run_docker_bash.sh
```

The full command inside the script is below.  There is also an explaination of each part for your reference.  

```{bash full_bash_cmd, eval = FALSE}
## if you are the super user on your computer
docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/rstudio kdgosik/2020scworkshop bash

## if you need to access permission to run the command
sudo docker run --rm -it -v $PWD:/home/rstudio kdgosik/2020scworkshop bash

```


**Explaination of commands**
```{bash explain_cmd, eval = FALSE}
  - docker: command to run docker
  - run: asking docker to run a container
  - --rm: flag to remove the container when you exit from it
      - nothing will be saved from your session to access again later
      - this flag can be removed to keep container
  - -it: flag to run the container interactively
    - this will keep all session output displaying on the terminal
    - to stop container go to terminal and press Crtl+c
    -v $PWD:/home/rstudio: map your home directory to a directory inside docker container called home
  - kdgosik/2020scworkshop: the image to run.  It will be the image into a container if not already built on your computer
    - [image link](https://hub.docker.com/r/kdgosik/2020scworkshop)
  - bash: The entry point into the container.  Start on the bash command line
```
