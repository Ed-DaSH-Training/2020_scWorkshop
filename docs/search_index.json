In contrast to bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq provides quantitative measurements of the expression of every gene in a single cell. However, to analyze scRNA-seq data, novel methods are required and some of the underlying assumptions for the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq experiments are no longer valid. In this course we will cover all steps of the scRNA-seq processing, starting from the raw reads coming off the sequencer. The course includes common analysis strategies, using state-of-the-art methods and we also discuss the central biological questions that can be addressed using scRNA-seq. 1.2 TARGETED AUDIENCE &amp; ASSUMED BACKGROUND This course is aimed at researchers and technical workers who are or will be analyzing scRNA-seq data. The material is suitable both for experimentalists who want to learn more about data-analysis as well as computational biologists who want to learn about scRNASeq methods. Examples demonstrated in this course can be applied to any experimental protocol or biological system. The requirements for this course are: 1. Working knowledge of unix (managing files, running programs) 2. Programming experience in R (writing a function, basic I/O operations, variable types, using packages). Bioconductor experience is a plus. 3. Familiarity with next-generation sequencing data and its analyses (using alignment and quantification tools for bulk sequencing data) 1.3 COURSE FORMAT The course will be delivered over the course of five days. Each day will include a lecture and laboratory component. The lecture will introduce the topics of discussion and the laboratory sessions will be focused on practical hands-on analysis of scRNA-seq data. These sessions will involve a combination of both mirroring exercises with the instructor to demonstrate a skill as well as applying these skills on your own to complete individual exercises. After and during each exercise, interpretation of results will be discussed as a group. Computing will be done using a combination of tools installed on the attendees laptop computer and web resources accessed via web browser. 1.4 Getting Started 1.5 SESSION CONTENT 1.5.1 Monday – Classes from 08:00 to 16:00 (lunch break-1 hr, 40 min of total coffee breaks) Shared Google doc - course notes, ideas/questions/challenges/interesting topics you would like to explore. 1.5.1.1 Lecture 1 – scRNA-Seq experimental design (Orr) Overview of course General introduction: cell atlas overviews Comparison of Bulk and single cell RNA-Seq Overview of available scRNA-seq technologies (10x) and experimental protocols scRNA-Seq experimental design and analysis workflow? 1.5.1.2 Lab 1 – Understanding sequencing raw data, downloading Docker if not done already (Kirk) 1.5.1.3 Lab based around data wrangling from public data repositories: get data from 10x website, single cell portal, from GEO (fastqs, counts) Shell and Unix commands to navigate directories, create folders, open files Raw file formats 1.5.1.4 Lecture 2 - Intro to Data processing: from bcl file to bam file, Transcriptome quantification: from bam file to counts (Dana) scRNA-Seq processing workflow starting with choice of sequencer (NextSeq, HiSeq, MiSeq) / barcode swapping and bcl files Overview of Popular tools and algorithms Common single-cell analyses and interpretation Sequencing data: alignment and quality control Looking at cool things in alignment like where reads are, mutations, splicing Read &amp; UMI counting (Kallisto alignment-free pseudocounts as well), how RSEM works (length dependence, sequencing depth, multimapping reads), CellRanger (dropest), bustools 10x barcode structure and links to Perturb-seq Gene length &amp; coverage Gene expression units (count data Smart-seq2 counts or 10x UMIs vs expression data) 1.5.1.5 Lab 2 – Processing raw scRNA-Seq data (Dana), Docker setup (Kirk) Data outputs from different scRNAseq technologies (10x, Smart-seq2) - process both?

For this task, today we will be using a tool called FastQC. FastQC is a quality control tool for sequencing data, which can be used for both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data. FastQC takes sequencing data as input and returns a report on read quality. Copy and paste this link into your browser to visit the FastQC website: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ This website contains links to download and install FastQC and documentation on the reports produced. Fortunately we have already installed FastQC for you today, so instead we will take a look at the documentation. Scroll down the webpage to ‘Example Reports’ and click ‘Good Illumina Data’. This gives an example of what an ideal report should look like for high quality Illumina reads data. Now let’s make a FastQC report ourselves. Today we will be performing our analysis using a single cell from an mESC dataset produced by (Kolodziejczyk et al. 2015), which you downloaded froom the github link. The cells were sequenced using the SMART-seq2 library preparation protocol and the reads are paired end. First, let’s open the docker in a bash mode. open a terminal, cd to the docer folder (the folder you downloaded from github) and run this command: docker run --rm -ti -v $PWD:/home/rstudio -e DISABLE_AUTH=true kdgosik/2020scworkshop bash navigate to your data folder: cd home/rstudio/lab2data ls You should see the files that you downloaded from the dropbox link. Now let’s look at the files: less Teichmann_2i_2_2_1.fastq less Teichmann_2i_2_2_2.fastq We run fastqc from /usr/local/src/FastQC. You may need to give yourself permissions to run the file (hint: chmod) Task 1: run fastqc to view the quality of the reads chmod 755 /usr/local/src/FastQC/fastqc /usr/local/src/FastQC/fastqc -h This command will tell you what options are available to pass to FastQC. Let us direct our output to our personal directories (under the folder results). Feel free to ask for help if you get stuck! If you are successful, you should generate a .zip and a .html file for both the forwards and the reverse reads files. Once you have been successful, feel free to have a go at the next section. /usr/local/src/FastQC/fastqc -o &lt;output_folder&gt; Teichmann_2i_2_2_1.fastq Teichmann_2i_2_2_2.fastq Once the command has finished executing, you should have a total of four files - one zip file for each of the paired end reads, and one html file for each of the paired end reads. The report is in the html file. for those working in AWS, if you want to view the file you will need to download it to your computer. The scp command is: scp -r -i &lt;your pem file&gt; &lt;username&gt;@ec2-34-213-180-241.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/&lt;file to copy&gt; &lt;destination in your computer&gt; Once the file is on you computer, click on it. Your FastQC report should open. Have a look through the file. Remember to look at both the forwards and the reverse end read reports! How good quality are the reads? Is there anything we should be concerned about? 5.3.1 Fastq file format FastQ is the most raw form of scRNASeq data you will encounter. All scRNASeq protocols are sequenced with paired-end sequencing. Barcode sequences may occur in one or both reads depending on the protocol employed. However, protocols using unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) will generally contain one read with the cell and UMI barcodes plus adapters but without any transcript sequence. Thus reads will be mapped as if they are single-end sequenced despite actually being paired end. FastQ files have the format: &gt;ReadID READ SEQUENCE + SEQUENCING QUALITY SCORES 5.4 Align the reads 5.4.1 STAR align Now we have established that our reads are of good quality, we would like to map them to a reference genome. This process is known as alignment. Some form of alignment is generally required if we want to quantify gene expression or find genes which are differentially expressed between samples. Many tools have been developed for read alignment, but today we will focus on STAR. For each read in our reads data, STAR tries to find the longest possible sequence which matches one or more sequences in the reference genome. Because STAR is able to recognize splicing events in this way, it is described as a ‘splice aware’ aligner. Usually STAR aligns reads to a reference genome, potentially allowing it to detect novel splicing events or chromosomal rearrangements. However, one issue with STAR is that it needs a lot of RAM, especially if your reference genome is large (eg. mouse and human). To speed up our analysis today, we will use STAR to align reads from to a reference transcriptome of 2000 transcripts. Note that this is NOT normal or recommended practice, we only do it here for reasons of time. We recommend that normally you should align to a reference genome. Two steps are required to perform STAR alignment. In the first step, the user provides STAR with reference genome sequences (FASTA) and annotations (GTF), which STAR uses to create a genome index. In the second step, STAR maps the user’s reads data to the genome index. Let’s create the index now. Remember, for reasons of time we are aligning to a transcriptome rather than a genome today, meaning we only need to provide STAR with the sequences of the transcripts we will be aligning reads to. You can obtain transcriptomes for many model organisms from Ensembl (https://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html). Task 2: Create a genome index First create the output folder for the index in your personal folder under results (recommended /home/rstudio/lab2data/STAR/indices). We run STAR from: /usr/local/src/STAR/bin/Linux_x86_64 using the command: /usr/local/src/STAR/bin/Linux_x86_64/STAR --runThreadN 4 --runMode genomeGenerate --genomeDir &lt;output STAR indices folder&gt; --genomeFastaFiles /home/rstudio/lab2data/2000_reference.transcripts.fa Now that we have created the index, we can perform the mapping step. Task 4: Try to work out what command you should use to map our fastq files to the index you created. Use the STAR manual to help you. Once you think you know the answer use ./STAR command to align the fastq files to a BAM file. You can either create a SAM file and convert it to BAM using samtools, or use STAR to directly output a BAM file (–outSAMtype BAM Unsorted) /usr/local/src/STAR/bin/Linux_x86_64/STAR --runThreadN 4 --genomeDir &lt;genome_reference&gt; --readFilesIn /home/rstudio/lab2data/Teichmann_2i_2_2_1.fastq /home/rstudio/lab2data/Teichmann_2i_2_2_2.fastq --outFileNamePrefix &lt;output_folder&gt; --outSAMtype BAM Unsorted The alignment may take awhile, if you wish to you can complete tasks 7-10 in the meanwhile. 5.4.2 Bam file format BAM file format stores mapped reads in a standard and efficient manner. The human-readable version is called a SAM file, while the BAM file is the highly compressed version. BAM/SAM files contain a header which typically includes information on the sample preparation, sequencing and mapping; and a tab-separated row for each individual alignment of each read. Alignment rows employ a standard format with the following columns: QNAME : read name (generally will include UMI barcode if applicable) FLAG : number tag indicating the “type” of alignment, link to explanation of all possible “types” RNAME : reference sequence name (i.e. chromosome read is mapped to). POS : leftmost mapping position MAPQ : Mapping quality CIGAR : string indicating the matching/mismatching parts of the read (may include soft-clipping). RNEXT : reference name of the mate/next read PNEXT : POS for mate/next read TLEN : Template length (length of reference region the read is mapped to) SEQ : read sequence QUAL : read quality BAM/SAM files can be converted to the other format using ‘samtools’: samtools view -S -b file.sam &gt; file.bam samtools view -h file.bam &gt; file.sam Some sequencing facilities will automatically map your reads to the a standard genome and deliver either BAM or CRAM formatted files. Generally they will not have included ERCC sequences in the genome thus no ERCC reads will be mapped in the BAM/CRAM file. To quantify ERCCs (or any other genetic alterations) or if you just want to use a different alignment algorithm than whatever is in the generic pipeline (often outdated), then you will need to convert the BAM/CRAM files back to FastQs: BAM files can be converted to FastQ using bedtools. To ensure a single copy for multi-mapping reads first sort by read name and remove secondary alignments using samtools. Picard also contains a method for converting BAM to FastQ files. Bonus: To make our aligned BAM file easy to navigate (needed for IGViewer) we will sort and index it using samtools. Sam tools can be run from everywhere (no need to go to a special directory!) using the command: samtools Let us start by sorting the BAM file: samtools sort Aligned.out.bam -o Aligned.out.sorted.bam Task 6: can you index the file? hint: try looking at samtools -h samtools index Aligned.out.sorted.bam Once you sorted and indexed the files you should have a BAM and a bai files. The BAM file is the aligned reads, and the bai is an index file. To view them in IGViewer (IGV) first copy them into your computer. Go ahead and copy the fa file as well, we will need a reference genome file. 5.5 Visualization To view the file we will use the IGV you installed on your personal computer. Open IGV: the default genomes are human HG19 and HG38. Through the class we will be using the PBMC dataset. You have the BAM file in your data folder. Go ahead and transfer it to your computer and upload it to IGV with hg38 as reference genome. Task 7: Browse to MS4A1, this is a blood cell marker. Can you see the exons and the introns? Where are most of the aligned reads? Task 8: Search in IGV or online - can you present splice junctions? (right click -&gt; “Show splice junction track”) Task 9: Try further tasks that interest you in IGV. For example, can you detect reads that are within one exon and reads that start in one exon and continue in the next? Can you copy the sequence of exon2 in MS4A1? Task 10: What would have happened if you chose the wrong reference genome, such as hg19? Bonus 2 (IGV sometimes has difficulties loading small fa files. So if this becomes difficult - don’t worry! It’s not your alignment): The default genomes are human HG19 and HG38. However you can also upload your reference genome of choice. As we created our own fasta file we can now upload it as a reference genome. Task 11: Load new genome: go to “Genomes”-&gt;”Load from file” and load the file 2000_reference.transcripts.fa Task 12: Now load your reads: go to “File”-&gt;”Load from file” and load your BAM file. Notice that IGV needs a BAM and a bai saved in the same location. IGV uses the bai to navigate through the BAM file. Task 13: Some of the reads have a nucleotide substitution in position 993 - what is the reference nucleotide? What is the substitution? "],

There is no guarantee a package uploaded to github will even install, nevermind do what it claims to do. R packages can be downloaded and installed directly from github using the “devtools” package installed above. ## username/repository devtools::install_github(&quot;satijalab/seurat&quot;) # latest stable version of Seurat package Github is also a version control system which stores multiple versions of any package. By default the most recent “master” version of the package is installed. If you want an older version or the development branch this can be specified using the “ref” parameter: # different branch devtools::install_github(&quot;satijalab/seurat&quot;, ref=&quot;release3.0&quot;) # previous commit ## Merge branch &#39;develop&#39; into feat/MultiModal ## - Shiwei Zheng committed on Jul 2, 2018 devtools::install_github(&quot;tallulandrews/M3Drop&quot;, ref=&quot;551014f488770627ab154a62e59d49df5df98a3f&quot;) Note: make sure you re-install the M3Drop master branch for later in the course. 6.2.3 Bioconductor Bioconductor is a repository of R-packages specifically for biological analyses. It has the strictest requirements for submission, including installation on every platform and full documentation with a tutorial (called a vignette) explaining how the package should be used. Bioconductor also encourages utilization of standard data structures/classes and coding style/naming conventions, so that, in theory, packages and analyses can be combined into large pipelines or workflows. Bioconductor also requires creators to support their packages and has a regular 6-month release schedule. Make sure you are using the most recent release of bioconductor before trying to install packages for the course. ## &gt;= R 3.5.0 if (!requireNamespace(&quot;BiocManager&quot;, quietly = TRUE)) install.packages(&quot;BiocManager&quot;) BiocManager::install(&quot;Rsamtools&quot;, ask = FALSE) 6.2.4 Source The final way to install packages is directly from source. In this case you have to download a fully built source code file, usually packagename.tar.gz, or clone the github repository and rebuild the package yourself. Generally this will only be done if you want to edit a package yourself, or if for some reason the former methods have failed. You can also get previous packages that aren’t supported any more on the CRAN package archive ## Get an old package and install from source install.packages(&quot;GenABEL_1.8-0.tar.gz&quot;, type=&quot;source&quot;) 6.3 Installation instructions: All the packages necessary for this course are available here. A list of the packages will be on the README.md for the repository. A script is also available inside the docker/install.R file. 6.3.1 Classes/Types R is a high level language so the underlying data-type is generally not important. The exception if you are accessing R data directly using another language such as C, but that is beyond the scope of this course. Instead we will consider the basic data classes: numeric, integer, logical, and character, and the higher level data class called “factor”. You can check what class your data is using the “class()” function. 6.3.1.1 Integer x &lt;- 4 ## assign value of 4 to x class(x) ## check class of x ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; is.integer(x) ## check if x is an integer ## [1] FALSE is.numeric(x) ## check if x is numeric ## [1] TRUE x &lt;- as.numeric(x) ## assign x to be an numeric is.numeric(x) ## check if the assignment worked ## [1] TRUE class(x) ## check if the assignment worked ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; x ## check value of x ## [1] 4 6.3.1.2 Numeric ## assign value of 1.414 to y y &lt;- 1.414 ## check class of y class(y) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## check if y is numeric is.numeric(y) ## [1] TRUE ## check if y is an integer is.integer(y) ## [1] FALSE ## assign y to be an integer y &lt;- as.integer(y) ## check if the assignment worked is.integer(y) ## [1] TRUE ## check value of y y ## [1] 1 6.3.1.3 Logical/ Boolean The logical class stores boolean truth values, i.e. TRUE and FALSE. It is used for storing the results of logical operations and conditional statements will be coerced to this class. Most other data-types can be coerced to boolean without triggering (or “throwing”) error messages, which may cause unexpected behaviour. z &lt;- TRUE ## assign value of TRUE to z class(z) ## check class of z ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; is.logical(z) ## check if z is of logical type ## [1] TRUE 6.3.2 Data structures Homogeneous 1D: atomic vector 2D: matrix nD: array Heterogeneous 1D: list 2D: data.frame 6.3.2.1 Character Vectors ## assign a character vector with c() operator character_vector &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot;) ## check class class(character_vector) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; ## access the 3rd element with [] operator ## *note*: R is index starts at 1 (other programming languages start at 0) character_vector[3] ## [1] &quot;T&quot; ## access 3rd through 6th elemenet character_vector[3:6] ## [1] &quot;T&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;T&quot; ## access the elements 1,4,7,10 with c() character_vector[c(1, 4, 7, 10)] ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;G&quot; &quot;A&quot; ## access all the A&#39;s character_vector[grep(&quot;A&quot;, character_vector)] ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; &quot;A&quot; 6.3.2.2 Numeric Vector The “numeric” class is the default class for storing any numeric data - integers, decimal numbers, numbers in scientific notation, etc… ## assign a character vector with c() operator numeric_vector &lt;- c(1, 5, 21, 17, 98, 35, 11, 13) ## check class class(numeric_vector) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## access the 5th element with [] operator numeric_vector[5] ## [1] 98 ## access 2nd through 4th elemenet numeric_vector[2:4] ## [1] 5 21 17 ## backticks ` ` allow you to give names with non-typical characters `numeric?_vector` &lt;- c(&quot;A&quot;, 1, 5, 21, 17, 98, 35, 11, 13) ## check vector `numeric?_vector` ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;21&quot; &quot;17&quot; &quot;98&quot; &quot;35&quot; &quot;11&quot; &quot;13&quot; ## check class (Notice the quotation marks on the numbers!) class(`numeric?_vector`) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; 6.3.2.3 Factor Vector String/Character data is very memory inefficient to store, each letter generally requires the same amount of memory as any integer. Thus when storing a vector of strings with repeated elements it is more efficient assign each element to an integer and store the vector as integers and an additional string-to-integer association table. Thus, by default R will read in text columns of a data table as factors. factor_vector &lt;- factor(numeric_vector) factor_vector ## [1] 1 5 21 17 98 35 11 13 ## Levels: 1 5 11 13 17 21 35 98 6.3.2.4 Named Vector names(numeric_vector) &lt;- paste0(&quot;Patient&quot;, 1 : length(numeric_vector)) numeric_vector ## Patient1 Patient2 Patient3 Patient4 Patient5 Patient6 Patient7 Patient8 ## 1 5 21 17 98 35 11 13 6.3.2.5 List ## change the c() operator to list() operator new_list &lt;- list(&quot;A&quot;, 1, 5, 21, 17, 98, 35, 11, 13) new_list ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;A&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 5 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 21 ## ## [[5]] ## [1] 17 ## ## [[6]] ## [1] 98 ## ## [[7]] ## [1] 35 ## ## [[8]] ## [1] 11 ## ## [[9]] ## [1] 13 ## get 2nd element of list new_list[[2]] ## [1] 1 names(new_list) &lt;- paste0(&quot;Patient&quot;, 1 : length(new_list)) new_list ## $Patient1 ## [1] &quot;A&quot; ## ## $Patient2 ## [1] 1 ## ## $Patient3 ## [1] 5 ## ## $Patient4 ## [1] 21 ## ## $Patient5 ## [1] 17 ## ## $Patient6 ## [1] 98 ## ## $Patient7 ## [1] 35 ## ## $Patient8 ## [1] 11 ## ## $Patient9 ## [1] 13 ## get 2nd element of list new_list[[2]] ## [1] 1 2D 6.3.2.6 matrix Create Matrix ## create numeric matrix numeric_matrix &lt;- matrix(sample(1:10, 100, replace = TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10) class(numeric_matrix) ## check class ## [1] &quot;matrix&quot; Check Structure str(numeric_matrix) ## int [1:10, 1:10] 9 10 5 10 3 9 1 3 5 4 ...

In this lab, we will touch briefly on some of the features of the package. If you would like to learn more about how to use ggplot2, we would recommend reading “ggplot2 Elegant graphics for data analysis”, by Hadley Wickham or checking out his original paper on the package Data: Always start with the data, identify the dimensions you want to visualize. Aesthetics: Confirm the axes based on the data dimensions, positions of various data points in the plot. Also check if any form of encoding is needed including size, shape, color and so on which are useful for plotting multiple data dimensions. Scale: Do we need to scale the potential values, use a specific scale to represent multiple values or a range? Geometric objects: These are popularly known as ‘geoms’. This would cover the way we would depict the data points on the visualization. Should it be points, bars, lines and so on? Statistics: Do we need to show some statistical measures in the visualization like measures of central tendency, spread, confidence intervals? Facets: Do we need to create subplots based on specific data dimensions? Coordinate system: What kind of a coordinate system should the visualization be based on — should it be cartesian or polar? 6.5.2 Principles of ggplot2 Your data must be a dataframe if you want to plot it using ggplot2. Use the aes mapping function to specify how variables in the dataframe map to features on your plot Use geoms to specify how your data should be represented on your graph eg. as a scatterplot, a barplot, a boxplot etc. Data: Always start with the data, identify the dimensions you want to visualize. library(Seurat) library(ggplot2) gbm &lt;- pbmc_small@assays$RNA@data gbm &lt;- as.data.frame(as.matrix(t(gbm))) new_plot &lt;- ggplot(gbm) Aesthetics: Confirm the axes based on the data dimensions, positions of various data points in the plot.

To introduce you to scRNA-seq analysis using the Seurat package. 8.2 Introduction Data produced in a single cell RNA-seq experiment has several interesting characteristics that make it distinct from data produced in a bulk population RNA-seq experiment. Two characteristics that are important to keep in mind when working with scRNA-Seq are drop-out (the excessive amount of zeros due to limiting mRNA) and the potential for quality control (QC) metrics to be confounded with biology. This combined with the ability to measure heterogeniety from cells in samples has shifted the field away from the typical analysis in population-based RNA-Seq. Here we demonstrate some approaches to quality control, followed by identifying and analyzing cell subsets. For this tutorial, we will be analyzing the a dataset of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells (NSCLC) freely available from 10X Genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets/2.2.0/vdj_v1_hs_nsclc_5gex), using the Seurat R package (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), a popular and powerful set of tools to conduct scRNA-seq analysis in R. In this dataset, there are 7802 single cells that were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Please note this tutorial borrows heavily from Seurat’s tutorials, so feel free to go through them in more detail. 8.2.1 Load necessary packages When loading libraries, we are asking R to load code for us written by someone else. It is a convenient way to leverage and reproduce methodology developed by others. library(Seurat) library(dplyr) library(Matrix) library(gdata) 8.2.2 Read in NSCLC counts matrix. The data for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells (NSCLC) is freely available from 10X Genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets/2.2.0/vdj_v1_hs_nsclc_5gex). We start by reading in the counts matrix generated by the Cell Ranger count program. Task: Change the directory name to read your data dirname &lt;- &quot;data/&quot; counts_matrix_filename = paste0(dirname,&quot;/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/GRCh38/&quot;) counts &lt;- Read10X(data.dir = counts_matrix_filename) # Seurat function to read in 10x count data # To minimize memory use on the docker - choose only the first 1000 cells counts &lt;- counts[,1:1000] 8.2.3 Let’s examine the sparse counts matrix counts[1:10, 1:3] Here we see the upper left corner of the sparse matrix. The columns are indexed by 10x cell barcodes (each 16 nt long), and the rows are the gene names. We mentioned these matrices are sparse, here we see only zeroes (indicated by the “.” symbol); this is the most common value in these sparse matrices. Next, let us look at the dimensions of this matrix. 8.2.4 How big is the matrix? dim(counts) # report number of genes (rows) and number of cells (columns) Here we see the counts matrix has 33694 genes and 7802 cells. 8.2.5 How much memory does a sparse matrix take up relative to a dense matrix? object.size(counts) # size in bytes object.size(as.matrix(counts)) # size in bytes We see here that the sparse matrix takes 225 Mb in memory while storing the matrix in a dense format (where all count values including zeros are stored) takes almost 10 times as much memory! This memory saving is very important, especially as data sets are now being created that are beyond a million cells. These matrices can become unmanageable without special computing resources. In the sparse representation, we assume that the majority of count values in a matrix are zero. We only store the non-zero values. This is implemented in the Matrix package using a dgTMatrix object. 8.3 Filtering low-quality cells You can learn a lot about your scRNA-seq data’s quality with simple plotting. Let’s do some plotting to look at the number of reads per cell, reads per genes, expressed genes per cell (often called complexity), and rarity of genes (cells expressing genes). 8.3.1 Look at the summary counts for genes and cells counts_per_cell &lt;- Matrix::colSums(counts) counts_per_gene &lt;- Matrix::rowSums(counts) genes_per_cell &lt;- Matrix::colSums(counts&gt;0) # count gene only if it has non-zero reads mapped. Task: In a similar way, can you calculate cells per genes? replace the ‘?’ in the command below cells_per_gene &lt;- Matrix::?(counts&gt;?) # only count cells where the gene is expressed colSums and rowSums are functions that work on each row or column in a matrix and return the column sums or row sums as a vector. If this is true counts_per_cell should have 1 entry per cell. Let’s make sure the length of the returned vector matches the matrix dimension for column. How would you do that? ( Hint:length() ). Notes: 1. Matrix::colSums is a way to force functions from the Matrix library to be used. There are many libraries that implement colSums, we are forcing the one from the Matrix library to be used here to make sure it handles the dgTmatrix (sparse matrix) correctly. This is good practice. hist(log10(counts_per_cell+1),main=&#39;counts per cell&#39;,col=&#39;wheat&#39;) hist(log10(genes_per_cell+1), main=&#39;genes per cell&#39;, col=&#39;wheat&#39;) plot(counts_per_cell, genes_per_cell, log=&#39;xy&#39;, col=&#39;wheat&#39;) title(&#39;counts vs genes per cell&#39;) Here we see examples of plotting a new plot, the histogram. R makes this really easy with the hist function. We are also transforming the values to log10 before plotting, this is done with the log10 method. When logging count data, the + 1 is used to avoid log10(0) which is not defined. Can you a histogram of counts per gene in log10 scale? hist(?(?+1), main=&#39;counts per gene&#39;, col=&#39;wheat&#39;) 8.3.2 Plot cells ranked by their number of detected genes. Here we rank each cell by its library complexity, ie the number of genes detected per cell. This is a very useful plot as it shows the distribution of library complexity in the sequencing run. One can use this plot to investigate observations (potential cells) that are actually failed libraries (lower end outliers) or observations that are cell doublets (higher end outliers). plot(sort(genes_per_cell), xlab=&#39;cell&#39;, log=&#39;y&#39;, main=&#39;genes per cell (ordered)&#39;) 8.4 Beginning with Seurat: http://satijalab.org/seurat/ 8.4.1 Creating a seurat object To analyze our single cell data we will use a seurat object. Can you create an Seurat object with the 10x data and save it in an object called ‘seurat’? hint: CreateSeuratObject(). Can you include only genes that are are expressed in 3 or more cells and cells with complexity of 350 genes or more? How many genes are you left with? How many cells? seurat&lt;-CreateSeuratObject(counts = counts, ? = 3, ? = 350, project = &quot;10X_NSCLC&quot;) Almost all our analysis will be on the single object, of class Seurat. This object contains various “slots” (designated by seurat@slotname) that will store not only the raw count data, but also the results from various computations below. This has the advantage that we do not need to keep track of inidividual variables of interest - they can all be collapsed into a single object as long as these slots are pre-defined. The Assay class stores single cell data. For typical scRNA-seq experiments, a Seurat object will have a single Assay (“RNA”). This assay will also store multiple ‘transformations’ of the data, including raw counts ((???) slot), normalized data ((???) slot), and scaled data for dimensional reduction ((???) slot). seurat@assays$RNA is a slot that stores the original gene count matrix. We can view the first 10 rows (genes) and the first 10 columns (cells). seurat@assays$RNA[1:10,1:10] 8.5 Preprocessing step 1 : Filter out low-quality cells The Seurat object initialization step above only considered cells that expressed at least 350 genes. Additionally, we would like to exclude cells that are damaged. A common metric to judge this (although by no means the only one) is the relative expression of mitochondrially derived genes. When the cells apoptose due to stress, their mitochondria becomes leaky and there is widespread RNA degradation. Thus a relative enrichment of mitochondrially derived genes can be a tell-tale sign of cell stress. Here, we compute the proportion of transcripts that are of mitochondrial origin for every cell (percent.mito), and visualize its distribution as a violin plot. We also use the GenePlot function to observe how percent.mito correlates with other metrics. # The number of genes and UMIs (nGene and nUMI) are automatically calculated for every object by Seurat. For non-UMI # data, nUMI represents the sum of the non-normalized values within a cell We calculate the percentage of mitochondrial # genes here and store it in percent.mito using AddMetaData. We use object@raw.data since this represents # non-transformed and non-log-normalized counts The % of UMI mapping to MT-genes is a common scRNA-seq QC metric. mito.genes &lt;- grep(pattern = &quot;^MT-&quot;, x = rownames(x = seurat@assays$RNA@data), value = TRUE) percent.mito &lt;- Matrix::colSums(seurat@assays$RNA@data[mito.genes, ])/Matrix::colSums(seurat@assays$RNA@data) # AddMetaData adds columns to object@meta.data, and is a great place to stash QC stats. This also allows us to plot the # metadata values using the Seurat&#39;s VlnPlot(). head(seurat@meta.data) # Before adding Task: Can you add the percentage if mitochondrial genes to the seurat object meta data? If you dont remember the name of the parameter you can type ?AddMetaData in the console. An alternative way to add meta data is by using: seurat[[“percent.mito”]] &lt;- PercentageFeatureSet(seurat, pattern = “^MT-”) seurat &lt;- AddMetaData(object = seurat, ? = percent.mito, col.name = &quot;percent.mito&quot;) head(seurat@meta.data) # After adding VlnPlot(object = seurat, features = c(&quot;nFeature_RNA&quot;, &quot;nCount_RNA&quot;, &quot;percent.mito&quot;)) Here we calculated the percent mitochondrial reads and added it to the Seurat object in the slot named meta.data. This allowed us to plot using the violin plot function provided by Seurat. A third metric we use is the number of house keeping genes expressed in a cell. These genes reflect commomn processes active in a cell and hence are a good global quality measure. They are also abundant and are usually steadliy expressed in cells, thus less sensitive to the high dropout. # Load the the list of house keeping genes hkgenes &lt;- read.table(&quot;/home/rstudio/data/resources/tirosh_house_keeping.txt&quot;, skip = 2) hkgenes &lt;- as.vector(hkgenes$V1) # remove hkgenes that were not found hkgenes.found &lt;- which(toupper(rownames(seurat@assays$RNA@data)) %in% hkgenes) Task: 1. Sum the number of detected house keeping genes for each cell 2.

For example, number of UMIs with number of genes? Can you plot the nGene vs nUMI? What is the correlation? Do you see a strange subpopulation? What do you think happened with these cells? FeatureScatter(object = seurat, feature1 = ?, feature2 = ?) 8.6 Examine contents of Seurat object str(seurat) These are the slots in the Seurat object. Some of the slots are automatically updated by Seurat as you move through analysis. Take a moment to look through the information, knowing the slots allow you to leverage work Seurat has already done for you. VlnPlot(object = seurat, features = c(&quot;nFeature_RNA&quot;), group.by = c(&#39;orig.ident&#39;)) Here we plot the number of genes per cell by what Seurat calls orig.ident. Identity is a concept that is used in the Seurat object to refer to the cell identity. In this case, the cell identity is 10X_NSCLC, but after we cluster the cells, the cell identity will be whatever cluster the cell belongs to. We will see how identity updates as we go throught the analysis. Next, let’s filter the cells based on the quality control metrics. Filter based on: 1. nFeature_RNA 2. percent.mito 3. n.exp.hkgenes Task: Change the thresholds to what you think they should be according to the violin plots VlnPlot(object = seurat, features = c(&quot;nFeature_RNA&quot;,&quot;percent.mito&quot;,&quot;n.exp.hkgenes&quot;), ncol = 3) seurat &lt;- subset(seurat, subset = nFeature_RNA &gt; 350 &amp; nFeature_RNA &lt; 4000 &amp; percent.mito &lt; 0.15 &amp; n.exp.hkgenes &gt; 55) How many cells are you left with? seurat 8.6.1 Preprocessing step 2 : Expression normalization After removing unwanted genes cells from the dataset, the next step is to normalize the data. By default, we employ a global-scaling normalization method “LogNormalize” that normalizes the gene expression measurements for each cell by the total expression, multiplies this by a scale factor (10,000 by default), and log-transforms the result. There have been many methods to normalize the data, but this is the simplest and the most intuitive. The division by total expression is done to change all expression counts to a relative measure, since experience has suggested that technical factors (e.g. capture rate, efficiency of reverse transcription) are largely responsible for the variation in the number of molecules per cell, although genuine biological factors (e.g. cell cycle stage, cell size) also play a smaller, but non-negligible role. The log-transformation is a commonly used transformation that has many desirable properties, such as variance stabilization (can you think of others?). seurat &lt;- NormalizeData(object = seurat, normalization.method = &quot;LogNormalize&quot;, scale.factor = 1e4) Well there you have it! A filtered and normalized gene-expression data set. A great accomplishment for your first dive into scRNA-Seq analysis. Well done! 8.7 Detection of variable genes across the single cells Seurat calculates highly variable genes and focuses on these for downstream analysis. FindVariableFeatures calculates the average expression and dispersion for each gene, places these genes into bins, and then calculates a z-score for dispersion within each bin. This helps control for the relationship between variability and average expression. seurat &lt;- FindVariableFeatures(seurat, selection.method = &quot;vst&quot;, nfeatures = 2000) # Identify the 10 most highly variable genes top10 &lt;- head(VariableFeatures(seurat), 10) # plot variable features with and without labels plot1 &lt;- VariableFeaturePlot(seurat) plot2 &lt;- LabelPoints(plot = plot1, points = top10, repel = TRUE, xnudge = 0, ynudge = 0) plot1 + plot2 8.8 Gene set expression across cells Sometimes we want to ask what is the expression of a set of a genes across cells. This set of genes may make up a gene expression program we are interested in. Another benefit at looking at gene sets is it reduces the effects of drop outs. Below, we look at genes involved in: T cells, the cell cycle and the stress signature upon cell dissociation. We calculate these genes average expression levels on the single cell level, while controlling for technical effects. # Read in a list of cell cycle markers, from Tirosh et al, 2015. # We can segregate this list into markers of G2/M phase and markers of S phase. cc.genes &lt;- readLines(&quot;/home/rstudio/data/resources/regev_lab_cell_cycle_genes.txt&quot;) s.genes &lt;- cc.genes[1:43] g2m.genes &lt;- cc.genes[44:97] seurat &lt;- CellCycleScoring(seurat, s.features = s.genes, g2m.features = g2m.genes, set.ident = TRUE) Task: Use markers for dissociation to calculate dissociation score # Genes upregulated during dissociation of tissue into single cells. genes.dissoc &lt;- c(&quot;ATF3&quot;, &quot;BTG2&quot;, &quot;CEBPB&quot;, &quot;CEBPD&quot;, &quot;CXCL3&quot;, &quot;CXCL2&quot;, &quot;CXCL1&quot;, &quot;DNAJA1&quot;, &quot;DNAJB1&quot;, &quot;DUSP1&quot;, &quot;EGR1&quot;, &quot;FOS&quot;, &quot;FOSB&quot;, &quot;HSP90AA1&quot;, &quot;HSP90AB1&quot;, &quot;HSPA1A&quot;, &quot;HSPA1B&quot;, &quot;HSPA1A&quot;, &quot;HSPA1B&quot;, &quot;HSPA8&quot;, &quot;HSPB1&quot;, &quot;HSPE1&quot;, &quot;HSPH1&quot;, &quot;ID3&quot;, &quot;IER2&quot;, &quot;JUN&quot;, &quot;JUNB&quot;, &quot;JUND&quot;, &quot;MT1X&quot;, &quot;NFKBIA&quot;, &quot;NR4A1&quot;, &quot;PPP1R15A&quot;, &quot;SOCS3&quot;, &quot;ZFP36&quot;) #### seurat &lt;- AddModuleScore(?, genes.list = list(?), ctrl.size = 20, enrich.name = &quot;genes_dissoc&quot;) seurat &lt;- AddModuleScore(seurat, features = list(genes.dissoc), ctrl.size = 20, enrich.name = &quot;genes_dissoc&quot;) Task: Plot the correlation between number of genes and S score.

We evaluated 36 approaches using experimental and synthetic data and found considerable differences in the number and characteristics of the genes that are called differentially expressed. Prefiltering of lowly expressed genes has important effects, particularly for some of the methods developed for bulk RNA-seq data analysis. However, we found that bulk RNA-seq analysis methods do not generally perform worse than those developed specifically for scRNA-seq. We also present conquer, a repository of consistently processed, analysis-ready public scRNA-seq data sets that is aimed at simplifying method evaluation and reanalysis of published results. Each data set provides abundance estimates for both genes and transcripts, as well as quality control and exploratory analysis reports. (???) Cells are the basic building blocks of organisms and each cell is unique. Single-cell RNA sequencing has emerged as an indispensable tool to dissect the cellular heterogeneity and decompose tissues into cell types and/or cell states, which offers enormous potential for de novo discovery. Single-cell transcriptomic atlases provide unprecedented resolution to reveal complex cellular events and deepen our understanding of biological systems. In this review, we summarize and compare single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, that were developed since 2009, to facilitate a well-informed choice of method. The applications of these methods in different biological contexts are also discussed. We anticipate an ever-increasing role of single-cell RNA sequencing in biology with further improvement in providing spatial information and coupling to other cellular modalities. In the future, such biological findings will greatly benefit medical research. (???) 10.2 Seurat Tutorial Redo For this tutorial, we will be analyzing the a dataset of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells (NSCLC) freely available from 10X Genomics (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-vdj/datasets/2.2.0/vdj_v1_hs_nsclc_5gex), using the Seurat R package (http://satijalab.org/seurat/), a popular and powerful set of tools to conduct scRNA-seq analysis in R. In this dataset, there are 7802 single cells that were sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000.

The goal of these algorithms is to learn the underlying manifold of the data in order to place similar cells together in low-dimensional space. Cells within the graph-based clusters determined above should co-localize on these dimension reduction plots.

By default, it identifes positive and negative markers of a single cluster (specified in ident.1), compared to all other cells. FindAllMarkers automates this process for all clusters, but you can also test groups of clusters vs. each other, or against all cells. The min.pct argument requires a feature to be detected at a minimum percentage in either of the two groups of cells, and the thresh.test argument requires a feature to be differentially expressed (on average) by some amount between the two groups. You can set both of these to 0, but with a dramatic increase in time - since this will test a large number of features that are unlikely to be highly discriminatory. As another option to speed up these computations, max.cells.per.ident can be set. This will downsample each identity class to have no more cells than whatever this is set to. While there is generally going to be a loss in power, the speed increases can be significiant and the most highly differentially expressed features will likely still rise to the top. # find all markers of cluster 1 using default parameters cluster1.markers &lt;- FindMarkers(object = seurat, ident.1 = 1, min.pct = 0.1) head(cluster1.markers) Task: Try tuning different parameters.

Although well-established tools exist for such analysis in bulk RNA-seq data, methods for scRNA-seq data are just emerging. Given the special characteristics of scRNA-seq data, including generally low library sizes, high noise levels and a large fraction of so-called ‘dropout’ events, it is unclear whether DE methods that have been developed for bulk RNA-seq are suitable also for scRNA-seq. Check the help page out for the FindMarkers function by using ?FindMarkers ## Differential expression using t-test FindMarkers(object = seurat, ident.1 = 0, ident.2 = 1, test.use = &quot;t&quot;) Task: Try to use different test for diffential expression analysis (hint: ?FindMarkers) ## Use the help function and run other tests. Do they find similar markers? FindMarkers(object = seurat, ident.1 = 0, ident.2 = 1, test.use = ??) 10.3.2 Check Clusters How do we test the cell types identified? How do we know how reliable they are? Use Classifier to predict cell cluster. See how it predicts using hold out data. reference # Assign the test object a three level attribute groups &lt;- sample(c(&quot;train&quot;, &quot;test&quot;), size = NROW(seurat@meta.data), replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.8, 0.2)) names(groups) &lt;- colnames(seurat) seurat &lt;- AddMetaData(object = seurat, metadata = groups, col.name = &quot;group&quot;) # Find Anchors seurat.list &lt;- SplitObject(seurat, split.by = &quot;group&quot;) seurat.anchors &lt;- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = seurat.list, dims = 1:30) seurat.integrated &lt;- IntegrateData(anchorset = seurat.anchors, dims = 1:30) seurat.query &lt;- seurat.list[[&quot;train&quot;]] seurat.anchors &lt;- FindTransferAnchors(reference = seurat.integrated, query = seurat.query, dims = 1:30) predictions &lt;- TransferData(anchorset = seurat.anchors, refdata = seurat.integrated$ClusterNames_0.6, dims = 1:30) seurat.query &lt;- AddMetaData(seurat.query, metadata = predictions) table(seurat.query@meta.data$ClusterNames_0.6, seurat.query@meta.data$predicted.id) 10.3.3 View Entire Object Structure Notice all the slots and elements added to the object. str(seurat) 10.4 Probabilistic (LDA) Clustering Another type of clustering we can do is a fuzzy or probablistic clustering. This is where cells are not assigned to specifically only one cluster. They get assigned a score for how much the cells belong to each of the clusters (sometimes called topics). This can be helpful for when your dataset continuous processes and/or cellular states as opposed to distinct cell types. 10.4.1 Example LDA in Bulk data(&quot;MouseDeng2014.FitGoM&quot;) names(MouseDeng2014.FitGoM) omega &lt;- MouseDeng2014.FitGoM$clust_6$omega annotation &lt;- data.frame( sample_id = paste0(&quot;X&quot;, c(1:NROW(omega))), tissue_label = factor(rownames(omega), levels = rev(c(&quot;zy&quot;, &quot;early2cell&quot;, &quot;mid2cell&quot;, &quot;late2cell&quot;, &quot;4cell&quot;, &quot;8cell&quot;, &quot;16cell&quot;, &quot;earlyblast&quot;, &quot;midblast&quot;, &quot;lateblast&quot;))) ) rownames(omega) &lt;- annotation$sample_id; StructureGGplot(omega = omega, annotation = annotation, palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(8, &quot;Accent&quot;), yaxis_label = &quot;Amplification batch&quot;, order_sample = TRUE, axis_tick = list(axis_ticks_length = .1, axis_ticks_lwd_y = .1, axis_ticks_lwd_x = .1, axis_label_size = 7, axis_label_face = &quot;bold&quot;)) 10.4.2 PBMC LDA 10.4.2.1 Fitting the Model set.seed(2020) ## Preprocessing Steps pbmc_small &lt;- NormalizeData(object = pbmc_small, normalization.method = &quot;LogNormalize&quot;, scale.factor = 10000) pbmc_small &lt;- RunPCA(object = pbmc_small) pbmc_small &lt;- FindClusters(object = pbmc_small, reduction = &quot;pca&quot;, dims.use = 1:10, resolution = 1, print.output = 0) ## Grab the Raw Count Matrix from Seurat Object ## Needs count matrix pbmc_counts &lt;- as.matrix(pbmc_small@assays$RNA@counts) pbmc_meta &lt;- pbmc_small@meta.data gene_names &lt;- rownames(pbmc_counts) ## Fit LDA Model, called GoM for this R pacakge ## Number of topics to fit is K=4 pbmc_FitGoM &lt;- FitGoM(t(pbmc_counts), K=4) ## Grab topic scores omega &lt;- data.frame(pbmc_FitGoM$fit$omega) ## Annotate topics, if identies known annotation &lt;- data.frame(sample_id = rownames(omega), tissue_label = paste0(&quot;cluster&quot;, pbmc_small@active.ident)) colnames(omega) &lt;- paste0(&quot;topic&quot;, 1:4) rownames(omega) &lt;- annotation$sample_id; ## Make plot to see topic contribution StructureGGplot(omega = omega, annotation = annotation, palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(4, &quot;Dark2&quot;), yaxis_label = &quot;Cells&quot;, order_sample = TRUE, axis_tick = list(axis_ticks_length = .1, axis_ticks_lwd_y = .1, axis_ticks_lwd_x = .1, axis_label_size = 7, axis_label_face = &quot;bold&quot;)) # ## Add Topic Scores to Meta Data Part of the Seurat Object pbmc_small &lt;- AddMetaData(pbmc_small, omega) 10.4.2.2 Summarizing Topic By Cluster pbmc_small@meta.data %&gt;% group_by(RNA_snn_res.1) %&gt;% summarise(topic1 = mean(topic1), topic2 = mean(topic2), topic3 = mean(topic3), topic4 = mean(topic4)) 10.4.2.3 Visualizing Topic Scores ## ggplot object, you can add layers p1 &lt;- DimPlot(pbmc_small, reduction = &quot;tsne&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Resolution 1&quot;) ## return ggplot object p1 p2 &lt;- FeaturePlot(object = pbmc_small, features = c(&quot;topic1&quot;, &quot;topic2&quot;, &quot;topic3&quot;, &quot;topic4&quot;), cols = c(&quot;grey&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;), reduction = &quot;tsne&quot;) ## return ggplot object p2 p1 + p2 10.4.2.4 Extract Top Feature ## Gene scores for each topics theta_mat &lt;- pbmc_FitGoM$fit$theta top_features &lt;- ExtractTopFeatures(theta_mat, top_features=100, method=&quot;poisson&quot;, options=&quot;min&quot;) gene_list &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:dim(top_features$indices)[1], function(x) gene_names[top_features$indices[x,]])) We tabulate the top 5 genes for these 4 topics out_table &lt;- do.call(rbind, lapply(1:4, function(i) toString(gene_list[i,1:5]))) rownames(out_table) &lt;- paste(&quot;Topic&quot;, c(1:4)) out_table 10.4.3 Practice Visualizing/Embedding 10.4.3.1 tSNE Change the parameter settings for tSNE RunTSNE() 10.4.3.2 UMAP Change the parameter settings for UMAP RunUMAP() 10.5 Other Options For Analysis More Seurat Vignettes Single Cell Analysis Workshop Hemberg Lab Course SingleCellExperiment Scanpy Pegasus "],

The important parameters in the batch correction are the number of factors (k), the penalty parameter (lambda), and the clustering resolution. The number of factors sets the number of factors (consisting of shared and dataset-specific factors) used in factorizing the matrix. The penalty parameter sets the balance between factors shared across the batches and factors specific to the individual batches. The default setting of lambda=5.0 is usually used by the Macosko lab.

These methods can order a set of individual cells along a path / trajectory / lineage, and assign a pseudotime value to each cell that represents where the cell is along that path. This can be a starting point for further analysis to determine gene expression programs driving interesting cell phenotypes. As you are running the code, think about how the algorithms work and what you like and do not like about the assumptions and utilities provided by the algorithm. 14.1 Load settings and packages 14.2 First look at the differentiation data from Deng et al. We will use a nice SMART-Seq2 single cell RNA-seq data from Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Dynamic, Random Monoallelic Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells. Here is one relevant detail from their paper: “To investigate allele-specific gene expression at single-cell resolution, we isolated 269 individual cells dissociated from in vivo F1 embryos (CAST/EiJ × C57BL/6J, hereafter abbreviated as CAST and C57, respectively) from oocyte to blastocyst stages of mouse preimplantation development (PD)” # Read in single cell data. path.deng &lt;- paste0(mydir, &quot;deng-reads.rds&quot;) deng_SCE &lt;- readRDS(path.deng) # What class is the deng_SCE object, and how is it organized? class(deng_SCE) structure(deng_SCE) # How many mouse cells are at each stage? table(deng_SCE$cell_type1) table(deng_SCE$cell_type2) # Re-order the levels of the factor storing the cell developmental stage. deng_SCE$cell_type2 &lt;- factor(deng_SCE$cell_type2, levels = c(&quot;zy&quot;, &quot;early2cell&quot;, &quot;mid2cell&quot;, &quot;late2cell&quot;, &quot;4cell&quot;, &quot;8cell&quot;, &quot;16cell&quot;, &quot;earlyblast&quot;, &quot;midblast&quot;, &quot;lateblast&quot;)) 14.3 Principle Components Analysis Let us take a first look at the Deng data. One simple approach to ordering cells in pseudotime is to use PCA. By carrying out PCA and labeling the cells by the stage at which they were collected, we can see how well the principal components separate cells along a differentiation trajectory. # Run PCA on Deng data. Use the runPCA function from the SingleCellExperiment package. deng_SCE &lt;- runPCA(deng_SCE, ncomponents = 50) # Use the reducedDim function to access the PCA and store the results. pca &lt;- reducedDim(deng_SCE, &quot;PCA&quot;) # Describe how the PCA is stored in a matrix.

How does the separation look? 14.4 Diffusion map pseudotime Let us see how a more advance trajectory inference method, diffusion maps and diffusion pseudotime, performs at placing cells along the expected differentiation trajectory. Diffusion maps were introduced by Ronald Coifman and Stephane Lafon, and the underlying idea is to assume that the data are samples from a diffusion process. The method infers the low-dimensional manifold by estimating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the diffusion operator related to the data. Angerer et al have applied the diffusion maps concept to the analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data to create an R package called destiny. We will use two forms of pseudotime: the first diffusion component and the diffusion pseudotime. # Prepare a counts matrix with labeled rows and columns. deng &lt;- logcounts(deng_SCE) # access log-transformed counts matrix cellLabels &lt;- deng_SCE$cell_type2 colnames(deng) &lt;- cellLabels # Make a diffusion map. dm &lt;- DiffusionMap(t(deng)) # Optional: Try different sigma values when making diffusion map. # dm &lt;- DiffusionMap(t(deng), sigma = &quot;local&quot;) # use local option to set sigma # sigmas &lt;- find_sigmas(t(deng), verbose = FALSE) # find optimal sigma # dm &lt;- DiffusionMap(t(deng), sigma = optimal_sigma(sigmas)) # Plot diffusion component 1 vs diffusion component 2 (DC1 vs DC2). tmp &lt;- data.frame(DC1 = eigenvectors(dm)[, 1], DC2 = eigenvectors(dm)[, 2], Timepoint = deng_SCE$cell_type2) ggplot(tmp, aes(x = DC1, y = DC2, colour = Timepoint)) + geom_point() + scale_color_tableau() + xlab(&quot;Diffusion component 1&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Diffusion component 2&quot;) + theme_classic() # Try plotting higher diffusion components against one another. # Next, let us use the first diffusion component (DC1) as a measure of pseudotime. # How does the separation by cell stage look? deng_SCE$pseudotime_diffusionmap &lt;- rank(eigenvectors(dm)[,1]) # rank cells by their dpt ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(deng_SCE)), aes(x = pseudotime_diffusionmap, y = cell_type2, colour = cell_type2)) + geom_quasirandom(groupOnX = FALSE) + scale_color_tableau() + theme_classic() + xlab(&quot;Diffusion component 1 (DC1)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Timepoint&quot;) + ggtitle(&quot;Cells ordered by DC1&quot;) ggsave(paste0(mydir, &quot;/pseudotime_DC1.png&quot;)) # Plot eigenvalues of diffusion distance matrix.
